Path of Exile Orb Calculator
============================

What is it?
-----------

Basicly it was only a table to calculate the exchange rates for various orbs in [Path of Exile](http://www.pathofexile.com/).
But I decided to promote the project. So some extra features were added like a simple DPS calculator and
a Skill Tree calculator. There are more features to come and alot of other stuff is in the pipeline. 
So stay tuned =) 

Highlights
----------

I wrote alot of usefull stuff in ExtJs so far. I also tried to make it as abstract and reusable as possibile.
Most of them can be found in the library folder.

Here are some of them:

* [Multilanguage Support](https://github.com/4rg0n/poe_orb_calc/blob/master/js/ext/app/library/language/Language.js)
* [Exceptions](https://github.com/4rg0n/poe_orb_calc/blob/master/js/ext/app/library/exception/Exception.js)
* [Symfony 2 like Services](https://github.com/4rg0n/poe_orb_calc/blob/master/js/ext/app/library/service/Service.js)
* [Error Handling](https://github.com/4rg0n/poe_orb_calc/blob/master/js/ext/app/library/error/ErrorManager.js)
